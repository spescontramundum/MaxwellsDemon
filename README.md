# MaxwellsDemon
Pong-like game modelled on the Mawell's Demon thought experiment
### Description
A single-player game in which the goal is to direct all the randomly-moving particles to the left-hand side of the screen, at which point the player wins. The player loses if the number of particles on the LHS is less than the number on the RHS. The 'lowest score' of the player is determined by how long it takes them to get all the particles grouped on the LHS of the screen. 
# Getting Started
Maxwell's Demon was designed using Python 3.10 and uses the PyGame, SciPy, Numpy, and Random python modules. It can be tested by runnint the test_game.py file contained in the project, which covers boundary cases, basic physics, movement commands and proper scoring, but given that it IS a computer a game exploratory testing is necessary to determine usability and possible semantic errors.
